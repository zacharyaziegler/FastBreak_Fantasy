# FastBreak Fantasy

_A fantasy basketball league creator application_

---

## Overview

This project is a **Fantasy Basketball application** built in **Kotlin** for Android as part of our Computer Science Senior Project. The app allows users to create leagues, invite their friends, draft NBA players, set their weekly lineups, and compete against friends in a head-to-head format. 

It was developed by a team of four students with the goal of combining real-time NBA data with a smooth user experience.

This project gave us hands-on experience with the **Agile Software Development Lifecycle**, full-stack mobile development, team collaboration, and delivering a complex product on a deadline.
